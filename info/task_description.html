    <a href="">The Dark Labyrinth</a> was a training before this challenge.
    You in a labyrinth again. It's dark here and we don't have a flashlight.
    But we have ultrasound scanner and can define a depth of passages in four directions.
    If you think that your problems are over, then we have news - you have problems with memory
    and can remember only 100 bits between runs.
</p>

<p>
    The labyrinth has size 12x12 cells and surrounded by walls.
    You are running in the dark, so be careful to not struck in a wall.
    This is a "multicall" mission and as such, your function will be called until you have solved
    the maze or run out of moves.
    For each iteration you receive a dictionary with information about distances for walls
    in four directions: "N" - North, "S" - South, "W" - West and "E" -
    East. For example if a neighbour cell is wall, then the distance is 0.
    You will see the exit only when you will be on the exit cell.
</p>
<p>
    The second function argument is a "memory" number. For each iteration we restart environment,
    thus you can not store data in global variables. Memory numbers is 100 bit, so it can be
    from 0 (including) to 2<sup>100</sup>(excluding).
</p>

<p>
   For each iteration your function should return one or several actions as a string with
    directions and a memory number. Actions are described as directions:
    "N" - North, "S" - South, "W" - West and "E" - East.
    For example: the string "NWS" describes a sequence of three moves.
    The memory number is an integer 0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;2**100.
    This number will be given in your function.
    You run too fast so you shouldnâ€™t make a move that would have you walk into a wall.
    To make things interesting, you are limited to 300 moves (not iterations).

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments.
        A scanner results as a dictionary and a memory number as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A tuple or a list with the action string and a memory number.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept is exporing mechanism with strong restricts,
    but this could work even with deficiency of information.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    The labyrinth are surrounded by walls.<br>
    len(maze) == 12<br>
    all(len(row) == len(maze) for row in visible)
